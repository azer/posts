Between 2006 and 2008, I followed JavaScript and Python news from Del.ico.us' popular feeds.
Although the community of Delicious was quite picky, there were always daily blogs,
new articles and important news links from other websites. 

The web is chaotic, growing with unobservable speed. Since it gets more expensive to collect and
rate archives of it, people's own efforts should be used for collecting and rating page contents,
instead of web crawlers and related mechanisms. And we need some social networks to organize these
efforts. Thus, we'll be able to adjust the quality scala of the search we make. Imagine that being
able to search the bookmarks of well known coders, travellers, chess players... 

Unfortunately, current popular search tool Google will never make us able to access the libraries of
the people of different networks. We'll keep losing time by familiarizing with communuties.

Social bookmarking has the enough potential to solve this problem. It's simple as a URL, chaotic
as the Web in the big picture. Letting people organize and share their bookmarks is the first step
of a community driven search engine that lets users to choose what network to search. I believe that
it's the only way of letting people adjust the quality of search results.

What reason would stop this revolutionary idea? 


It might sound assertive, but I believe that search engines can't keep getting better in the future.
No economy and technology can keep
