Imagine a universe growing instantly and its environment includes necessary resources and basic production devices for its folk who live peacefully without borders,
governments, militaries. Because of this, everything is free and entire production devices are under control of throughout of the humanity, which means more production.
Additionally, they have teleportation to distribute/buy products, and that means easier&faster distribution. Sounds so cool, right? I'm talking about the Web, we have invented
a some kind of universe with includes a teleportation network by default! We can produce by using free tools and distribute our products to entire world, for almost free. The
only problem we can't solve is that we have to design our products for old teleportation clients since most of the people who are not aware of modern teleportation tools
because they preferred to live in private property of the "genius" Richie Rich. 

Even I'm pretty happy to see [great technical effort](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer_9#Improvements_on_previous_versions) on the future of Internet Explorer
but it's a disappointment to see that there is nothing changed about business approach of Microsoft that seems to believe that they can act like an oil company, control all of
the production devices. This is why I'm still not excited about Internet Explorer. This may sound like if I'm a fan of an any other web browser embracing more social business
models but I'm pretty ok with technical approach of Microsoft. I'm following [IEBlog](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie) for years and learning lots of things from the posts about
their development experiences, also think that [MSDN](http://msdn.com) is one of the great resources for us. The only think I contradict to is business models of Microsoft
products.

On the other hand, Internet Explorer isn't the only proprietary browser which belongs to a commercial company, we have Safari and several mobile web browsers, too. The only
difference between mobile browser of IPhones with Internet Explorer 6 is that Iphone one is a little better, not much. Distribution methods are almost.  same, companies are
different. I see them as future of IE6 candidates.  

To summarize, the main issue about web is whether to take the advantage of modern distribution methods or not. Even if all of the web browsers follow the web standards, we
will continue to lose time for the software coming from back since implementation times differ between months and years. Because of this reason, all of the
rendering/javascript engines should be open source, able to update itself automatically and totally independent from any browser. This is why the web need immediately.
